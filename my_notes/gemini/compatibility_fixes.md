# Note: Compatibility Fixes

This document records changes made to scripts and configurations to ensure they work together correctly, which is useful for future debugging or if a revert is needed.

### 1. `ModuleNotFoundError` in `config.py`

- **Problem:** `config.py` (from the phospho version) contained an import for `openpi.policies.so100_policy_single`, but the corresponding file `so100_policy_single.py` did not exist in the workspace.
- **Fix:** The unused import statement was removed from `src/openpi/training/config.py`.

### 2. `AttributeError` in `compute_norm_stats.py`

- **Problem:** The `compute_norm_stats.py` script was written to expect a `rlds_data_dir` attribute in the `DataConfig` object, which is not present in the version of `config.py` we are using.
- **Fix:** The script `scripts/compute_norm_stats.py` was modified to check for the attribute safely.
    - **Changed from:** `if data_config.rlds_data_dir is not None:`
    - **Changed to:** `if getattr(data_config, "rlds_data_dir", None) is not None:`

### 3. `KeyError` for `actions` column (Data Loader)

- **Problem:** The data loader was looking for a data column named `"actions"` (plural) by default, but the `clear_tray_3cam` dataset provides this data under the key `"action"` (singular).
- **Fix:** Modified the `LeRobotClearTrayDataConfig` in `src/openpi/training/config.py` to explicitly specify `action_sequence_keys=("action",)`, ensuring the data loader looks for the correct column name.

### 4. `KeyError` for `actions` key (Policy Transform)

- **Problem:** After fixing the data loader, the `S0100Inputs` transform within `so100_policy.py` was still expecting the raw data to contain an `"actions"` (plural) key, when it should have been looking for `"action"` (singular). This caused the actions to be dropped from the final batch.
- **Fix:** Modified `src/openpi/policies/so100_policy.py` to read from `data["action"]` instead of `data["actions"]`.

### 5. `ImportError` for `s3fs` and Reverting to Google Cloud Storage

- **Problem:** The training script failed with `ImportError: Install s3fs to access S3`. This was because the `config.py` we were using pointed to `s3://` paths for downloading pre-trained models, but the required `s3fs` library was not a project dependency.
- **Investigation:** We inspected `pyproject.toml` and found the project explicitly specifies `fsspec[gcs]`, indicating it's designed to use Google Cloud Storage (`gs://`), not S3.
- **Fix:** We reverted all `s3://` paths to `gs://` in `src/openpi/training/config.py` to align the configuration with the project's declared dependencies. This ensures the correct cloud storage library (`gcsfs`), which is installed automatically by `uv pip sync` or `uv pip install`, is used.

These changes were necessary to align scripts with the newer configuration standards we adopted.
