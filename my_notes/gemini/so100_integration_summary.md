# SO-100 Single-Arm Integration Summary

This document summarizes the work done to integrate a custom single-arm SO-100 robot, using the `JiabinQ/clear_tray_3cam` dataset, into the `openpi` framework.

### Objective

The goal was to create a full, end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuning a base model on a custom dataset and providing a client to run the resulting policy on the robot.

---

### 1. Policy Creation (`src/openpi/policies/so100_policy.py`)

We adapted the policy file to correctly process the custom dataset.

- **Initial State:** The file was originally configured for a dual-arm robot (12 actions).
- **Key Changes Made:**
    1.  **State Handling:** Updated the logic to use the single `observation.state` key provided by the `clear_tray_3cam` dataset, which contains 6 values (5 joints + 1 gripper).
    2.  **Image Handling:** Replaced placeholder camera names with the specific keys from the dataset: `observation.images.top`, `observation.images.wrist`, and `observation.images.side`.
    3.  **Action Dimension:** Corrected the output action trimming from 12 dimensions to 6, matching the single-arm robot's degrees of freedom.
    4.  **Helper Function:** Updated the `make_so100_example` function to generate data consistent with the single-arm configuration, improving clarity and testability.

### 2. Training Configuration (`src/openpi/training/config.py`)

We configured the training environment to recognize and use the new policy and dataset.

- **Initial State:** There were two conflicting configuration files (`config.py` and `config_phospho.py`).
- **Key Changes Made:**
    1.  **File Consolidation:** We established a single source of truth by renaming the outdated `config.py` to `config.py.original` and promoting the new `config_phospho.py` to `config.py`.
    2.  **New Data Recipe:** Added the `LeRobotClearTrayDataConfig` class. This acts as a "data recipe" that connects the `clear_tray_3cam` dataset to the logic in our updated `so100_policy.py`.
    3.  **New Experiment Blueprint:** Added a new `TrainConfig` named `pi0_clear_tray_fine_tune`. This provides a complete, runnable configuration for the fine-tuning experiment.

### 3. Inference Client (`examples/so100_single_client/`)

A new, minimal client was added to provide a clear example of how to run the newly trained single-arm policy.

- **Purpose:** This client connects to the policy server, captures camera frames, reads the robot's state, and sends observations that are perfectly matched with the format expected by our new `so100_policy`.
- **Key Features:**
    - It demonstrates how to map real camera devices to the logical camera names the policy expects (`top` -> `main.left`, `wrist` -> `secondary_0`).
    - It supports multiple modes for robot hardware interaction (`http`, `lerobot`, or `none` for debugging).

### Final Outcome

The result of these changes is a complete, end-to-end setup. You can now use the following command to train a model for your specific robot and dataset:

```bash
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9 uv run scripts/train.py pi0_clear_tray_fine_tune --exp-name=my_first_so100_run --overwrite
```

Once trained, the `examples/so100_single_client/main.py` script can be used to load the checkpoint and run the policy for inference.
