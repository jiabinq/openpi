# Log: Git Merge Conflict Resolution

This document logs the process of resolving a `git push` failure that occurred when trying to sync local changes with the remote fork at `https://github.com/jiabinq/openpi.git`.

### 1. Initial Problem

An attempt to `git push` local commits failed with the following error:

```
! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: 无法推送一些引用到 'https://github.com/jiabinq/openpi.git'
```

This indicated that the remote repository contained commits that were not present in the local repository, requiring a `git pull` before pushing was possible.

### 2. Merge Conflicts

Executing `git pull` resulted in merge conflicts in three local files, as the remote changes and local changes affected the same portions of these files:

*   `scripts/compute_norm_stats.py`
*   `src/openpi/training/config.py`
*   `src/openpi/training/data_loader.py`

### 3. Local File Modifications

To resolve these conflicts, the following local files were modified by merging the conflicting code sections:

1.  **`scripts/compute_norm_stats.py`**: The conflict around the `num_workers` parameter was resolved. The final version keeps the local change (`num_workers=0`) that is necessary for the user's current configuration, while integrating it into the new code structure from the remote branch.

2.  **`src/openpi/training/config.py`**: This file had significant conflicts. The resolution involved manually merging the two sets of changes:
    *   The local `LeRobotClearTrayDataConfig` and its related settings (`local_files_only`) were kept.
    *   The remote `RLDSDroidDataConfig` and its related settings (`rlds_data_dir`, `action_space`, etc.) were also integrated.
    *   The result is a unified `config.py` that supports both the user's custom `clear_tray` configuration and the `DROID` configuration from the remote.

3.  **`src/openpi/training/data_loader.py`**: The file was rewritten with the correctly merged content, resolving the conflict.

### 4. Finalization

After the conflicts were resolved locally, the following steps were taken:

1.  The modified files were staged using `git add`.
2.  A new merge commit was created with the message: `"Merge remote changes and resolve conflicts"`.
3.  The final, merged code was successfully pushed to the `main` branch of `https://github.com/jiabinq/openpi.git`.

As a result of this process, the local repository and the remote fork are now synchronized. The three files listed above have been modified on the local filesystem.
