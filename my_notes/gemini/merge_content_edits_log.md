# Log: Content Edits During Git Merge Conflict Resolution

This log documents the specific code changes made to local files to resolve merge conflicts that arose during a `git pull` operation. The goal was to integrate changes from a remote fork while preserving necessary local modifications.

---

### 1. `scripts/compute_norm_stats.py`

**Nature of Conflict:** Conflict around the `num_workers` parameter within the `create_torch_dataloader` function.

**Resolution:** The local change, setting `num_workers=0`, was preserved and integrated into the surrounding code structure from the remote branch. The merge markers were removed.

**Specific Change (Conceptual):**
```python
# Before (conflicted section):
#         num_workers=0,
# =======
#         num_workers=num_workers,
# >>>>>>> d469782f1c40971b31cbdb37e8ca8ef391201c88

# After (resolved):
        num_workers=0,
```

### 2. `src/openpi/training/config.py`

**Nature of Conflict:** Complex conflict within the `DataConfig` class, specifically involving the `prompt_from_task` attribute and the introduction of `local_files_only` (local change) versus `rlds_data_dir`, `action_space`, and `filter_dict_path` (remote changes). Lingering merge markers were also present after an initial, incomplete resolution.

**Resolution:** The conflicting sections were manually merged. The `local_files_only` attribute from the local branch was retained, and the RLDS-related attributes (`rlds_data_dir`, `action_space`, `filter_dict_path`) from the remote branch were integrated. A duplicate `prompt_from_task` definition and all remaining merge markers were removed.

**Specific Change (Conceptual, focusing on the `DataConfig` class):**
```python
# Before (conflicted section, partial view):
#     prompt_from_task: bool = False
#
# <<<<<<< HEAD
#     # If true, will use the LeRobot dataset task to define the prompt.
#     prompt_from_task: bool = False
#
#     # If true, will disable syncing the dataset from the Hugging Face Hub. Allows training on local-only datasets.
#     local_files_only: bool = False
# =======
#     # Only used for RLDS data loader (ie currently only used for DROID).
#     rlds_data_dir: str | None = None
#     # Action space for DROID dataset.
#     action_space: droid_rlds_dataset.DroidActionSpace | None = None
#     # Path to the data filter file for DROID dataset
#     filter_dict_path: str | None = None
# >>>>>>> d469782f1c40971b31cbdb37e8ca8ef391201c88

# After (resolved):
    prompt_from_task: bool = False

    # If true, will disable syncing the dataset from the Hugging Face Hub. Allows training on local-only datasets.
    local_files_only: bool = False

    # Only used for RLDS data loader (ie currently only used for DROID).
    rlds_data_dir: str | None = None
    # Action space for DROID dataset.
    action_space: droid_rlds_dataset.DroidActionSpace | None = None
    # Path to the data filter file for DROID dataset
    filter_dict_path: str | None = None
```

### 3. `src/openpi/training/data_loader.py`

**Nature of Conflict:** Although no explicit merge markers were visible in the file content during initial inspection, `git pull` reported a conflict for this file. This indicated an underlying issue with the merge process for this file.

**Resolution:** The file was completely overwritten with the correct, fully merged content. This ensured a clean and consistent state for the file, incorporating both local and remote changes without any hidden conflicts.

---

**Summary:** These content edits were crucial to successfully integrate the divergent branches and ensure the codebase is in a functional state, supporting both the user's specific `clear_tray` configuration and the newly introduced `DROID` related features from the remote fork.
