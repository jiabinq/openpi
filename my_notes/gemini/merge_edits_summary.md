# Summary of Edits During Git Merge Conflict Resolution

This document provides a comprehensive log of the specific code modifications made to resolve merge conflicts that arose during a `git pull` operation. The conflicts occurred between local changes and updates from the remote fork (`https://github.com/jiabinq/openpi.git`).

---

### 1. `scripts/compute_norm_stats.py`

**Original Conflict:** The conflict involved the `num_workers` parameter within the `create_torch_dataloader` function. The local branch had explicitly set `num_workers=0`, while the remote branch used a variable `num_workers`.

**Changes Made:** The conflicted block was resolved by preserving the local setting. The merge markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) were removed.

**Rationale:** To ensure the script uses the desired `num_workers=0` setting for the user's local environment, while cleaning up the merge artifacts.

### 2. `src/openpi/training/config.py`

**Original Conflict:** This file presented a complex conflict within the `DataConfig` class. The local branch introduced `local_files_only`, while the remote branch added `rlds_data_dir`, `action_space`, and `filter_dict_path` for DROID dataset support. A duplicate `prompt_from_task` definition also contributed to the conflict. Multiple attempts were required to fully resolve this, as merge markers persisted.

**Changes Made (Initial Resolution):**
*   The `DataConfig` class was manually merged to include both the `local_files_only` attribute (from the local branch) and the RLDS-related attributes (`rlds_data_dir`, `action_space`, `filter_dict_path`) from the remote branch.
*   The duplicate `prompt_from_task` definition was removed.
*   The first set of merge markers was removed.

**Changes Made (Subsequent Resolution for Persistent SyntaxError):**
*   After the initial resolution, a `SyntaxError` indicated that some merge markers (`=======`, `>>>>>>>`) still remained in the file.
*   These remaining markers were identified and explicitly removed in a subsequent `replace` operation.

**Rationale:** The primary goal was to combine the features from both branches into a single, syntactically correct `DataConfig` class, supporting both the user's custom dataset setup and the newly integrated DROID dataset features. The subsequent fixes were to ensure the file was valid Python syntax after the complex merge.

### 3. `src/openpi/training/data_loader.py`

**Original Conflict:** `git pull` reported a conflict for this file, but upon inspection, no explicit `<<<<<<<` markers were immediately visible. This suggested an incomplete or problematic merge state for the file.

**Changes Made:** The entire file content was overwritten with the correct, fully merged version. This ensured all intended changes from both branches were present and that the file was in a clean, consistent, and syntactically correct state.

**Rationale:** To guarantee the integrity and correctness of the `data_loader.py` file, resolving any hidden or subtle merge issues by providing a definitive, correct version.

### Overall Impact

These detailed edits were critical for successfully integrating the divergent code branches. They ensure that the codebase now supports both the user's specific local configurations (e.g., `clear_tray` dataset, `num_workers=0`) and the new features introduced from the remote fork (e.g., RLDS DROID dataset support), while maintaining Python syntax validity.
